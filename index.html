            <h2>About This <em>Project</em></h2>
            <p>
              According to the City of Toronto’s 2024 Street Needs Assessment, an estimated 15,400 people experienced
              homelessness across the city last fall.
            </p>
            <p>
              Youth are not absent from these counts. Roughly one in five people experiencing homelessness in Toronto
              are youth—that’s about 2,000 young people every night.
            </p>
            <p>
              Homelessness intersects with marginalization. Young people experiencing homelessness are
              disproportionately Black, LGBTQ2S+, and newcomers, navigating multiple layers of discrimination and
              systemic barriers.
            </p>
            <div class="about-callouts">
              <h3>Homeless youth often face:</h3>
              <ul class="about-points">
                <li>Abuse and family conflict</li>
                <li>Discrimination and racism</li>
                <li>Exploitation and trafficking</li>
                <li>Poverty and chronic instability</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              No young person should have to shoulder these challenges alone. This website spotlights organizations that
              specialize in supporting marginalized youth through housing, education, health care, and community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, these agencies form a network of care, helping Toronto’s young people move from crisis toward
              safety, stability, and opportunity.

                <h4>Youth Without Shelter (YWS)</h4>
                <p>
                  Founded in 1986 by teachers and guidance counselors who saw the urgent need for safe emergency housing
                  and support, YWS has since helped thousands of youth experiencing homelessness build confidence,
                  develop life skills, and find stable housing and employment. Every night in Toronto, over 2,000 youth
                  face homelessness, yet there are only 435 emergency shelter beds available.
                  <br><br>
                  Programs include the Emergency Residential Program, Stay in School Program, Employment and Life Skills
                  training, and Mental Health and After-Care support. YWS provides not only shelter, but a pathway to
                  stability, education, and independence. By placing people, support, and programming first, YWS acts as
                  a vital intervention in breaking the cycle of homelessness.

                <h4>Eva’s Initiatives for Homeless Youth</h4>
                <p>
                  Across Canada, there is an overrepresentation of Black, racialized, and 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing
                  homelessness. Eva’s recognizes that 43% of homeless youth identify as Black — 72% of youth in Eva’s
                  programs identify as Black, compared to 9% of Torontonians.
                  <br><br>
                  Eva’s Employment and Training program provides skills-based, experiential training to help youth
                  access hands-on training, identify career goals, and secure entry-level employment. Their programs
                  actively work to bridge systemic gaps caused by racism, discrimination, and inequality in education,
                  helping youth gain independence and stability.

                <h4>The 519: LGBTQ2S+ Youth Homelessness</h4>
                <p>
                  Queer homelessness is a significant issue in Toronto, with 21% of youth in shelters identifying as
                  LGBTQ2S+. The 519 provides a vital refuge for queer and trans youth who often face discrimination and
                  violence in traditional shelter settings.
                  <br><br>
                  The 519 offers a space free from transphobia and homophobia, providing counselling, coming out groups,
                  trans programming, queer parenting resources, and senior support — creating a safe and affirming
                  environment for all.

                  Wellness Centre offers programs designed for newcomer, refugee, and immigrant youth, bridging the gap
                  left by limited federal support.
                  <br><br>
                  Their programs include counselling, leadership training, and hands-on employment programs such as the
                  Pre-Apprenticeship in Plumbing with George Brown College. WoodGreen connects participants to
                  affordable housing and community integration services, empowering newcomers to thrive in Canada.

                  Covenant House Toronto (CHT) is one of Canada’s largest and most well-known homelessness agencies.
                  Rooted in their mission of “serving the suffering children and youth on the street with absolute
                  respect and unconditional love,” CHT provides crisis shelter, transitional housing, health and
                  wellness services, and education and employment support.
                  <br><br>
                  Their scale allows them to influence policy, raise awareness, and collaborate with government
                  partners. CHT’s advocacy, care, and comprehensive programs make it a cornerstone in Toronto’s
                  homelessness network.

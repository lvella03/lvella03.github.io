							<h1>Learning with Digital Technology</h1>
							<p class="major">
								Digital technology supports school-wide learning by enhancing engagement, accessibility, and skill development across subject areas. 
								When used effectively, digital tools encourage inquiry, reinforce curriculum expectations, and allow students to apply learning in interactive and meaningful ways.
								Across disciplines, technology promotes independent learning, visual literacy, and differentiated instruction that meets the needs of diverse learners.

							<h2>World Geography Games</h2>
							<p>
								World Geography Games is an interactive, game-based learning website that allows students to practice and review geography concepts through visual and engaging activities.
								The site includes a wide range of topics such as maps, countries, physical features, climate, and environmental systems, making it a flexible tool for classroom use.
								Its simple layout and interactive design encourage independent exploration while reinforcing key geographic skills.

							<h2>Classroom Use & Pedagogical Value</h2>
							<p>
								In a Grade 9 Geography classroom, World Geography Games functions as an engaging tool for reviewing and applying concepts already introduced through instruction.
								The game-based format supports understanding and application, making it effective for consolidation rather than primary teaching.
								The website is highly user-friendly, allowing students to navigate independently while developing spatial skills such as map reading and directional awareness.
								This aligns with Ontario Curriculum expectations for <b>Geographic Inquiry and Skill Development (A1, A3)</b> in a low-pressure, accessible environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								The platform strongly supports physical geography topics emphasized in Grade 9, including mapping skills, cardinal directions, and Earth systems.
								Interactive visual activities support expectations <b> related to physical processes and patterns (B1.1, B1.2).</b>
								The built-in test mode promotes self-assessment and reflection, aligning with inquiry-based learning <b>(A1.6, A3.4)</b> and <b><i>Bloom’s Taxonomy</b></i> through evaluation of understanding.
								Framing practice as a game increases engagement and reduces the stigma around studying.
							</p>
							<p>
								Many activities are cross-disciplinary, covering topics such as the solar system, climate change, and the greenhouse effect, allowing use beyond geography in science and environmental studies.
								The website supports differentiated learning by enabling self-paced work with strong visual explanations and key terminology.
								This makes it particularly useful for students who struggle with note-taking or rapid information processing, supporting <b>inclusive and equitable learning practices (A1.1, A1.4).</b>

							<h2>Extending Learning Across Subjects</h2>
							<p>
								Digital tools like World Geography Games demonstrate how technology can support learning across subject areas by reinforcing core skills such as spatial thinking,
								visual analysis, and self-directed learning. These skills are transferable and valuable in geography, science, environmental studies, and beyond.

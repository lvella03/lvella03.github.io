									<h1>StoryMapJS</h1>
									<p>StoryMapJS is a free, open-source tool from Knight Lab that allows users to tell stories on the web highlighting the locations of a series of events.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>Tool Explanation and Functionality in a History Classroom</h2>
								<p>StoryMapJS is an interactive digital mapping tool that enables educators and their students to explore historical events and processes as a location narrative timeline. It creates a visual interactive journey where each event is connected into a larger story. Users can use a variety of map databases included on the website <b>(or even upload a custom map)</b> to customize the appearance of their chosen region and time period. After selection, users form a chronological string of visual pinpoints across a geographic area, each containing a location slide that contains images, text, social media posts, websites, articles, music, and/or videos to explain the significance of that point in space and time. It is a highly functional tool for a history course like World History since the Fifteenth Century, Grade 12  <b>(CHY4U)</b>, as it allows for both large-scale and human-centered historical processes to be visualized as an interactive journey <b>(A1, A2)</b>. It should be noted that while the tool is free to use, users require internet connection, a google account, and a computer for map creation. In addition to these requirements, teachers will need a projector and adequate surface for displaying StoryMaps in the classroom. See the video below for an example below of the tool in action.</p>
								
								<div class="video-container" style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
									<iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nLn2xYZBQeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<h2>Pedagogical Rationale and Curriculum alignment to CHY4U</h2>
								<p>In considering pedagogical rationale, the tool is advantageous due to its user-friendly interface, and thus would not require intensive training for students to use. Creating a map is intuitive and simple, as can be seen in the accompanying screenshot showing the start of a StoryMap I created to map the French Revolution/Napoleonic era.<br />
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/history2.png" alt="" /></div>
								The curriculum expectations for World History since the Fifteenth Century <b>(CHY4U)</b> place a heavy emphasis on the themes of Cause and Consequence of political/economic change <b>(B1, C1, D1)</b>, and the Continuity and Change of significant conflicts <b>(B2, C2, D2)</b>. StoryMap is an ideal tool for both of these objectives. Being able to visualize complicated processes as a visual interactive timeline helps to simplify potentially convoluted historical periods, like the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic era. For example, teachers can consolidate the many conquests <b>(and later defeats)</b> of Napoleon Bonaparte into a single StoryMap, thus highlighting how conflict results in significant changes to the balance of power on a continental scale <b>(D2)</b>. While a more traditional static image of Napoleon’s path can satisfy these expectations, StoryMap modifies functionality by adding multi-modal interaction that can work to retain attention and elevate student engagement <b>(Hennessy & Murphy, 2025, p. 195)</b>. Moreover, with the option to easily embed a wide variety of mediums, students are immersed with both audio and visuals. This in turn assists students in the process of historical inquiry by providing individual and interesting contexts <b>(on each point/slide of the map)</b> to the many events during the revolutionary period <b>(A1)</b>. I have created a rough sample StoryMap of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Era to highlight how the tool exhibits causes of political instability <b>(D1)</b> and the real change that results from historical conflict <b>(D2)</b>. If interested, my StoryMap can be found at: <a href="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/09ac8b8ec0be353a4a8d9daa57d1b924/example/draft.html">https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/09ac8b8ec0be353a4a8d9daa57d1b924/example/draft.html</a>.</p>

								<h2>Teaching Examples and Context Application</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/history0.png" alt="" /></span>StoryMapsJS can be used across multiple teaching contexts and subjects. Delivered live in a classroom, clicking through a StoryMap becomes a shared experience where educators and students go on a journey together. Asynchronously, students are given the opportunity to experience the journey at their own pace, which may encourage reflection and increase understanding <b>(Gosavi, 2025, pp. 276-277)</b>. The tool would be especially useful for teachers when summarizing large-scale processes where students may otherwise get confused with the overwhelming amount and dates and individual events. As a narrative tool, there is an opportunity to use StoryMaps for an examination of human-centered history. While teaching about the French Revolution, for instance, the map can show the real implications of political violence on non-combatants by highlighting accounts and stories of specific people/groups devastated by the war and political upheaval <b>(D1)</b>.</p>
								<p>Tasking students with creating their own maps would elevate the experience further. An assignment of this type would best be suited as an end-of-unit <b>(or even end-of-course)</b> culminating activity. With a course like World History <b>(CHY4U)</b>, over 500 years of events and processes are being examined. Asking students to pick historical processes that specifically interest them and make their own StoryMaps should result in a more engaging process wherein they demonstrate their understanding of how historical trends are formed through individual instances <b>(A1, A2)</b>. Another strength of the tool is that it can be worked on collaboratively, allowing multiple users to access and create maps simultaneously. The task would result in a diverse group of products that can be evaluated by the teacher and then shared with the whole class, allowing students to learn from each other and review before a test/exam.</p>
								<p>Outside of history, this tool would be a fantastic addition to geography classrooms <b>(as the example video shows)</b> and even for subjects like English, where educators/students could upload a map of a setting from a book or play and use the tool to visualize and connect the plot elements spatially. It is a highly versatile tool that can be used across subjects and grade-levels.</p>
